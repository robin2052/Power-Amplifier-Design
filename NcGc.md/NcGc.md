# Noise after matching significatnly decreased

## matching for the Gmax point , No Consideration about Nfmin

target 11dB gain and 4dB noise figure

In this case , I was trying to match the circuit for 11dB gain and noise of 4db. And the  the output come to 10.866 dB and the noise margin is  3.98 dB . Which is close to the desired value.

## Matching for Nfmin 

Target the gain is 10.3 dB and the Nf is 3.4 dB

# Question : When i  was focusing on the Nfmin the s11 parameter value is worst and when the  focus is on gainMax , the s11 parameter is in good condition. Why is That?
