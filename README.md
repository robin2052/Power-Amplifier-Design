# Power Amplifier Design Class A ( Common Source Topology)
At first we have to check the three parameters . if those parameters meets the specification then we will check the stability of the power amplifier. Those three parameters are  1. Transit frequency 2. Max Available Gain 3. Noise margin.

After checking those parameters, we have to check if the system is stable or not. To perform the stability test, we check the value of mu, k, and del.
## parameters that we will go through
