## What is max available Gain?
The maximum available gain of a transistor is basically the highest gain you can get out of it in a power amplifier circuit, assuming you've matched the output perfectly. It's a theoretical limit that doesn't consider the input matching.
## So, what are the parameters that max available gain depends on?
The maximum available gain mainly depends on the transistor's transconductance (gm) and its output resistance (ro as well as the operating frequency. It's also influenced by the parasitic capacitances and resistances inherent in the transistor and its layout.
# Now we will find the Max Available Gain for the transisor, and see how it varies
